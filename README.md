🔥 Challenges Faced

While deploying the project on GitHub Pages, I encountered a "Deceptive site ahead" warning. Here’s how I resolved it within 24 hours:
1. Checked all links and resources to ensure they used https:// instead of http://.
2. Enabled "Enforce HTTPS" in the GitHub Pages settings.
3. Used Google Search Console to check for security issues and requested a manual review — Google resolved it within 24 hours!
4. Rebuilt and redeployed the project by deleting the existing GitHub Pages setup and pushing a fresh commit.
5. Cleared the browser cache to remove any cached warnings.
