# Netflix-Clone
NetFlex is a responsive Netflix clone built with only HTML and CSS. It replicates the Netflix interface with a clean, modern design and responsive layout, making it adaptable to different screen sizes. While itâ€™s not functional yet, it showcases front-end development skills and a solid foundation for future improvements.

ðŸ”¥ Challenges Faced
While deploying the project on GitHub Pages, I ran into a "Deceptive site ahead" warning, which was frustrating. After some troubleshooting, hereâ€™s how I fixed it within 24 hours:

I checked all the links and resources to make sure they were using https:// instead of http://.
I enabled "Enforce HTTPS" in the GitHub Pages settings.
The most helpful step was using Google Search Console â€” I added the site, checked for security issues, and requested a manual review. Google reviewed it and removed the warning within 24 hours!
I rebuilt and redeployed the site by deleting the existing GitHub Pages setup and pushing a fresh commit.
Finally, I cleared my browser cache to remove any cached warnings.
After these steps, the site was live without any issues! ðŸ˜Ž
